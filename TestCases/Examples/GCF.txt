// A huge bin is filled with distinctly numbered balls, and you choose two of them at random. 
// What is the chance they share common denominator? 

Nb=30             // number of balls in bin

// Calculation up to Np-th prime
//   chance to have common denominators is equal to chance they share primes (other numbers would be repeating)
//   1/3rd of numbers are divisible by 3, 1/5th by 5, and 1/p are divisible by prime 'p'
//   chance to share 3 is 1/3*1/3 , to share 5 is 1/5*1/5, so chance to share any prime p is 1/p^2. 
//   chance NOT to share that prime p is 1-1/p^2, and chance not to share ANY p is product of those
//   so chance not to share ANY p is Product of 1-1/p^2 for all possible p's (since it is independent of each other)
//   and final chance to  have common denominator is 1-chance NOT to share any prime
pShareCalc(N)= 1- ∏((i)=> 1- 1/prime(i)^2, 1, N)
pShareCalc(Np)

// chance to share common denominator, almost for any number of balls N, is ~39% 
// Formula for infinite N, from symbolic solution of above pShareCalc(N) when N→inf, returns 39.21%
pShareInfiniteN= 1-6/π^2
