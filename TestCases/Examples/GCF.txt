// A huge bin is filled with distinctly numbered balls, and you choose two of them at random. 
// What is the chance they share common denominator? 

Nb=1000           // number of balls in bin
Np= primePi(Nb)   // number of primes in that bin

// Simulation - chance that two randomly picked numbers (up to N) share denominator
sim(N, nSim) =  pSim(()=>gcd(rndNumber(N)+1, rndNumber(N)+1)>1 , nSim)
sim(Nb,10000) 

// Calculation up to Np-th prime
//   chance to have common denominators is equal to chance they share primes (other numbers would be repeating)
//   chance to share 3 is 1/3*1/3 , to share 5 is 1/5*1/5, so chance to share any prime p is 1/p^2. Chance NOT to share that p is 1-1/p^2
//   chance not to share ANY p is Product of 1-1/p^2 for all possible p's (since it is independent of each other)
//   and final chance to  have common denominator is 1-chance NOT to share any prime
