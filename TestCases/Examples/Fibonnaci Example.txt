fib(x)= if(xâ‰¤1,x,fib(x-1)+fib(x-2))  // Fibonacci function in one line version

fib(1000)  // demonstrate fast calculation due to internal use of cached results for fib(x)
fib(2000)  // overflow due to 'double' limit of up to 10^308
fib(2000q) // workaround is to use larger number constant, suffix 'm' is for MPFR and 'q' for Quad
